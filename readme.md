# Moive Decider using Python üé•üêç
This project will be focused on creating a program that helps users decide on a movie to watch by providing recommendations based on the top 50 most popular movies for a year that the user inputs. The program will utilize Python and BeautifulSoup to implement algorithms for movie selection and user interaction, ultimately offering a convenient tool for movie enthusiasts to make informed decisions on what to watch.

## Road Map üó∫Ô∏è
This section is to plan out the sub-functions needed to make the whole program work

### Starter Steps 
1. ~~**Create the enviroment**~~
   - ~~Install BeautifulSoup and set it up~~
   - ~~Install a HTML Parser~~
2. ~~**Get Local URL and use BeautifulSoup with basic tasks**~~
   - ~~Host a Local HTML file~~
   - ~~Search for the data in the HTML file~~

3. ~~**Scrape Movie Data**~~
   ~~- Extract movie information (i.e. titles, ratings, and release years) from the URL.~~
   ~~- Store the scraped data~~

4. **Implement User Input Functionality**
   - Develop a function to allow user input for a specific year
   - Validate user input to ensure it corresponds to a valid year within the specified range

5. **Debug**
